## What's Inside

| Path | What it does | You need |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `scripts/` | Python scripts to call Ring APIs from your terminal | Python 3.8+ and a token |
| `app/` | Next.js web app with live video streaming and real-time event dashboard | Node.js 18+ and a token |

---

> 🚀 **Coming from the [Ring Developer Playground](https://developer.amazon.com/ring/console/playground)?**
>
> You already have a token — jump straight to:
> - **[Explore APIs from your terminal →](#step-2-explore-apis-python-scripts)** (Python, no web app needed)
> - **[Live stream in your browser →](#step-3-live-video-stream-web-app)** (Node.js, one command)

---

## Step 1: Get Your Token

1. Go to the [Ring Developer Playground](https://developer.amazon.com/ring/console/playground)
2. Click **Generate Token**
3. Copy the access token

The Playground gives you a short-lived access token (~30 minutes) that works with all Ring APIs. No app registration, OAuth setup, or client credentials needed — just the token.

> **Note:** When the token expires, return to the Playground and generate a fresh one.

---

## Step 2: Explore APIs (Python Scripts)

Call any Ring API directly from your terminal. Each script is a self-contained code snippet you can copy into your own project.

### Setup

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Run the interactive explorer:

```bash
python explore_apis.py --token "eyJ..."
```

This shows a menu where you pick which API to call:

```
=== Ring API Explorer ===
Use your token to call any Ring API.

1. List Devices
2. Device Status
3. Device Capabilities
4. Device Location
5. Device Configurations
6. Event History
7. User Profile
8. Run All
0. Exit

Select an API to call:
```

Or run individual scripts directly:

```bash
# List all your devices
python list_devices.py --token "eyJ..."

# Check if a device is online
python device_status.py --token "eyJ..." --device-id "ava1.ring.device.XXX"

# Get device capabilities (video codecs, motion detection, etc.)
python device_capabilities.py --token "eyJ..." --device-id "ava1.ring.device.XXX"

# Get device location (country/state)
python device_location.py --token "eyJ..." --device-id "ava1.ring.device.XXX"

# Get device configurations (motion zones, privacy zones)
python device_configurations.py --token "eyJ..." --device-id "ava1.ring.device.XXX"

# Get event history (motion events, doorbell presses, live views)
python event_history.py --token "eyJ..." --device-id "ava1.ring.device.XXX"

# Follow up to five history pages, preserving the API's filters and cursor
python event_history.py --token "eyJ..." --device-id "ava1.ring.device.XXX" \
  --event-types "motion.human,ding" --max-pages 5

# Get your user profile
python user_profile.py --token "eyJ..."
```

> **Tip:** If you don't pass `--device-id`, scripts that need one will auto-discover your first device.

Event history fetches one page by default. Set `--max-pages` to follow additional
pages, including empty pages that still have a continuation link. The returned
`data` contains the collected events; `links.next`, when present at the limit,
is the remaining continuation. Requests have a 30-second timeout. Repeated
continuations stop with a warning, preserving collected events as partial results
and retaining the repeated `links.next`. HTTP failures raise an error. Access remains limited to events after the
user's consent, as described in the [Event History API](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ring/api-documentation.html#event-history).

Run the offline pagination tests from the repository root:

```sh
python -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
python -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

These tests use synthetic HTTP fixtures and need no Ring token or device.

Each script prints the equivalent `curl` command so you can copy it into Postman, your own code, or any HTTP client:

```
→ GET https://api.amazonvision.com/v1/devices
  curl -X GET "https://api.amazonvision.com/v1/devices" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Available Scripts

| Script | API Endpoint | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `list_devices.py` | `GET /v1/devices` | List all accessible devices |
| `device_status.py` | `GET /v1/devices/{id}/status` | Check if device is online/offline |
| `device_capabilities.py` | `GET /v1/devices/{id}/capabilities` | Video codecs, motion detection, image enhancements |
| `device_location.py` | `GET /v1/devices/{id}/location` | Country and state (for compliance) |
| `device_configurations.py` | `GET /v1/devices/{id}/configurations` | Motion zones, privacy zones, image settings |
| `event_history.py` | `GET /v1/history/devices/{id}/events` | Past motion, doorbell, and live view events |
| `user_profile.py` | `GET /v1/users/me` | Your Ring account ID, name, and email |
| `explore_apis.py` | All of the above | Interactive menu to call any API |

## Step 3: Live Video Stream (Web App)

Stream live video from a Ring device directly in your browser using WebRTC.

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create your environment file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and paste your token from Step 1:

```env
RING_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJ...paste_your_token_here
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The app will:
1. Auto-discover devices associated with your token
2. Show a **Start Live Stream** button
3. Click it to begin a WebRTC live video stream from your Ring device

When the token expires, paste a fresh one from the Playground into `.env.local` and restart the server.

---

## Advanced: Full Dashboard (Refresh Token Mode)

For production integrations with long-lived sessions, the app supports OAuth refresh tokens with auto-renewal. This mode shows the full dashboard including webhook events, video processors, and canvas overlays.

### Setup

```env
RING_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
RING_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
RING_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
```

All three variables are required. The app automatically refreshes the access token when it expires.

See [Authentication](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ring/authentication.html) for how to obtain refresh tokens through the OAuth account linking flow, and [Configure Your Ring Application](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ring/app-registration.html) for how to get your client credentials.

### Device ID (Optional)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_RING_DEVICE_ID=your_device_id_here
```

If set, the app uses this device directly instead of auto-discovering.

### Important

Do not set both `RING_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `RING_REFRESH_TOKEN` — the app will show a configuration error. Use one or the other.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `RING_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Access token from the [Playground](https://developer.amazon.com/ring/console/playground) | Yes (if not using refresh token) |
| `RING_REFRESH_TOKEN` | OAuth refresh token from [account linking](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ring/authentication.html) | Yes (if not using access token) |
| `RING_CLIENT_ID` | OAuth client ID from [app registration](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ring/app-registration.html) | Yes (only with refresh token) |
| `RING_CLIENT_SECRET` | OAuth client secret from [app registration](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ring/app-registration.html) | Yes (only with refresh token) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RING_DEVICE_ID` | Device ID (skips auto-discovery) | No |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RING_DEVICE_NAME` | Display name for the device | No |
| `RING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Bearer token for [webhook auth](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ring/notifications.html) | No |

## Video Processors

Built-in processors (available in refresh token mode):

| Processor | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🎯 Catch the Logo | Hand-tracking game with fire effects |
| 🌡️ Motion Heatmap | Visualizes motion as color overlay |
| 💡 Brightness Analyzer | Analyzes frame brightness levels |

### Creating Custom Processors

```typescript
import {VideoProcessor, ProcessorResult} from './types';
import {processorRegistry} from './registry';

class MyProcessor implements VideoProcessor {
  id = 'my-processor';
  name = 'My Processor';
  description = 'Does something cool';
  enabled = false;

  async process(
    frame: ImageData,
    canvas: HTMLCanvasElement,
    video: HTMLVideoElement,
  ): Promise<ProcessorResult | null> {
    return {
      id: `my-${Date.now()}`,
      processorId: this.id,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
      data: {},
      boundingBoxes: [{x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100, label: 'Detected'}],
    };
  }
}

processorRegistry.register(new MyProcessor());
```

See [docs/video-processors.md](docs/video-processors.md) for the complete guide.

## Webhook Integration

Available in refresh token mode. The dashboard receives webhook events via POST and broadcasts them to connected clients via SSE.

```bash
# Send a test event
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event_type": "motion_detected", "device_id": "camera-1"}'
```

Configure your Ring webhook to POST to `/api/webhook`. Set `RING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local` for authentication.
